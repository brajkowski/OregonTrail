Welcome to Oregon Trail!

The year is 1847, and you have decided to leave your boring, simple, 9-5 life 
in Independence, Missouri behind. You are assured, like most people in 1847,
that a more exciting life is waiting for you in Oregon City, Oregon.

- You need to make it to Oregon City before 1847-11-30 or else you will freeze to death
- If you run out of food, you will starve to death
- If you run out of oxen, you cannot continue on the trail
- If you cannot repair your wagon, you cannot continue on the trail
- If your party leader dies, you cannot continue on the trail

You have saved $1600 to spend on supplies for the trip to Oregon,
and you had to spend $200 on a wagon.  The remaining $1400 can be
spent at the store in Independence before you leave.  There you
can buy:

- Oxen: You need to have enough oxen to pull the wagon but you only
    have enough spots for 10 oxen.  You will need to spend between
    $100-200 on oxen.  The more you have, the faster you will go!
    
- Food: Your wagon can hold up to 1000 pounds of food.  You will consume food every
    day you are on the trail.
    
- Ammo: You will need bullets for hunting animals and defending against
    raider attacks.
    
- Misc. Supplies: You can buy medical kits and spare wagon parts to aid
    with any sickness and to fix your wagon along the trail.
    
You can spend all your money before you leave, or
you can save some of your money to spend at forts encountered
on your journey.  Be aware that the forts will charge more for these
items, and you can also hunt for more food along the way.

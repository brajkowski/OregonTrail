You have saved $1600 to spend on supplies for the trip to Oregon,
and you had to spend $200 on a wagon.  The remaining $1400 can be
spent at the store in Independence before you leave.  There you
can buy:

- Oxen: You need to have enough oxen to pull the wagon but you only
    have enough spots for 8 oxen.  You will need to spend between
    $100-200 on oxen.  The more you have, the faster you will go!
    
- Food: You can buy any amount of food.  The more you have, the less
    chance there is of getting sick.
    
- Ammo: You will need bullets for attacks by animals and bandits, and
    for hunting food along the trail.
    
- Misc. Supplies: You can buy medical kits and spare wagon parts to aid
    with any sickness and to fix your wagon along the trail.
    
You can spend all your money before you leave, or
you can save some of your money to spend at forts encountered
on your journey.  Be aware that the forts will charge more for these
items, and you can also hunt for more food along the way.

YOU HAD SAVED $1600 TO SPEND FOR THE TRIP, AND YOU'VE JUST PAID
$200 FOR A WAGON. YOU WILL NEED TO SPEND THE REST OF YOUR MONEY
ON THE FOLLOWING ITEMS:
- OXEN. YOU CAN SPEND $100-$200 ON YOUR TEAM. THE MORE YOU SPEND, THE FASTER
YOU'LL GO BECAUSE YOU'LL HAVE BETTER ANIMALS
- FOOD. THE MORE YOU HAVE, THE LESS CHANCE THERE IS OF GETTING SICK
- AMMUNITION - YOU WILL NEED BULLETS FOR ATTACKS BY ANIMALS AND BANDITS, AND FOR
HUNTING FOOD
- MISCELLANEOUS SUPPLIES. THIS INCLUDES MEDICINE AND OTHER THINGS YOU WILL NEED
FOR SICKNESS AND EMERGENCY REPAIRS
YOU CAN SPEND ALL YOUR MONEY BEFORE YOU START YOUR TRIP, OR
YOU CAN SAVE SOME OF YOUR CASH TO SPEND AT FORTS ALONG THE
WAY WHEN YOU RUN LOW. HOWEVER, ITEMS COST MORE AT THE FORTS.
YOU CAN ALSO GO HUNTING ALONG THE WAY TO GET MORE FOOD.
